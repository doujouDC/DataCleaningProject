abstract = {Academic libraries are increasingly engaging in data curation by providing infrastructure and services to support the management of research data on their campus. Efforts to develop these resources can benefit from a greater understanding of the social factors that affect how researchers manage their data during and after their research projects. In particular, the age or amount of experience of researchers is often thought to be an important factor influencing their viewpoints on research data sharing and preservation. In this study, we categorized faculty members who responded to our campus-wide survey on research data management into four ranks-professor, associate professor, assistant professor, and non-tenure track- and analyzed differences in their patterns of survey responses. We found statistically significant differences among faculty ranks in familiarity with funding agency requirements for data management plans, reasons that might prevent data sharing, and interest in potential research data services. These findings reveal key distinctions among different ranks of faculty members in their outlook toward research data management, which can help guide academic librarians and data curation professionals to develop research data services that are tailored to the unique needs of specific populations of researchers.

abstract = {A range of external pressures are causing research data management (RDM) to be an increasing concern at senior level in universities and other research institutions. But as well as external pressures, there are also good reasons for establishing effective research data management services within institutions which can bring benefits to researchers, their institutions and those who publish their research. In this article some of these motivating factors, both positive and negative, are described. Ways in which libraries can play a role - or even lead - in the development of RDM services that work within the institution and as part of a national and international research data infrastructure are also set out.

abstract = {This project sought to develop an integrated framework for managing the subscribed databases of the Nanyang Technological University Library (NTU Library). It aimed to provide a single workflow for the administration of the subscribed databases and information web pages, as well as to provide a modern and intuitive end-user interface for library patrons. New features to connect with social networks for information dissemination and sharing purposes were also added. Findings: The initial workflow was disjointed and involved many parties in publishing subscribed database's information on the database Web pages. This delayed the process of getting the information to the end-user. After reviewing the system and working with the IT support to enhance the workflow, the publishing of a subscribed database on the webpage could be done much faster. The Subject librarians no longer need to know HTML coding as a WYSIWYG user interface using CSS technology was provided and control was put at their fingertips to publish or update the database information pages under their purview in real time.

@article{Badia2014,
abstract = {Objective -- The research project examined university faculty's publications in order to find professors with previous data experiences. The professors could then be approached with an offer of the library's data services. Design -- Bibliographic study. Setting -- Department of Crop Sciences in the College of Agricultural, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Subjects - A total of 62 assistant, associate, and full professors. Methods -- The author searched Web of Science and faculty web pages to find each of the subjects' two most recent research or review articles. Altogether, 124 articles were read to check whether data sources were used and shared. Data sources were defined as sources other than traditional citations to literature for information or ideas, such as data repositories, supplementary files, and weather stations. Data sharing was defined as publicly sharing data beyond that published in the journal article, such as providing supplementary files with the article or submitting data sets to a disciplinary repository (p. 205). Main Results -- Thirty of the 124 articles, which were written by 20 different professors, referred to additional data that was made openly accessible. The analysis of the articles uncovered a variety of data experiences, such as faculty who utilized repository data, published supplementary files, submitted their own data to repositories, or posted data on their university's website. These 20 faculty members were contacted and asked for a meeting "to discuss their data sharing thoughts and experiences and to ask whether they [saw] a role for the library in facilitating data sharing" (p. 206). The author received a positive response from seven of the faculty members and had a successful meeting with each of them. Conclusion -- A bibliographic study can be employed to select which professors to target for data services. While this method is time-consuming, it allows librarians to gather rich data about faculty research that will help them to create customized, relevant messages to professors about the library's data services. It also allows them to become more knowledgeable about data practices and resources in a particular discipline.

abstract = {Children with special health care needs (CSHCN) may present unique challenges for disaster preparedness. This study's objective was to determine the impact of a disaster supply starter kit intervention on preparedness for families of CSHCN. The study was a 1-group pre-post cohort design with consecutive enrollment at the Arkansas Children's Hospital Medical Home Clinic. Pre- and postintervention survey findings were compared using McNemar's test. Of the 249 enrolled, 223 completed the postsurvey. At presurvey, 43{\%} had an Emergency Information Form, compared with 79{\%} at postsurvey (P {\textless}.001). At presurvey, 18{\%} had a disaster kit, compared with 99.6{\%} at postsurvey, and 44{\%} added items. Of the 183 respondents who did not have a disaster kit at presurvey, 99{\%} (n = 182) had a disaster kit on postsurvey, and 38{\%} (n = 70) added items. An inexpensive educational disaster supply starter kit may increase preparedness. Further investigation on sustainability and dissemination to other populations is needed. {\textcopyright} SAGE Publications.},

abstract = {Purpose Many organizations are seeking unicorn data scientists, that rarest of breeds that can do it all. They are said to be experts in many traditionally distinct disciplines, including mathematics, statistics, computer science, artificial intelligence, and more. The purpose of this paper is to describe authors' pursuit of these elusive mythical creatures.Design/methodology/approach Qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews with managers/directors from nine Australian state and federal government agencies with relatively mature data science functions.Findings Although the authors failed to find evidence of unicorn data scientists, they are pleased to report on six key roles that are considered to be required for an effective data science team. Primary and secondary skills for each of the roles are identified and the resulting framework is then used to illustratively evaluate three data science Master-level degrees offered by Australian universities.Research limitations/implications Given that the findings presented in this paper have been based on a study with large government agencies with relatively mature data science functions, they may not be directly transferable to less mature, smaller, and less well-resourced agencies and firms.Originality/value The skills framework provides a theoretical contribution that may be applied in practice to evaluate and improve the composition of data science teams and related training programs.

abstract = {The US health care system is rapidly adopting electronic health records, which will dramatically increase the quantity of clinical data that are available electronically. Simultaneously, rapid progress has been made in clinical analytics-techniques for analyzing large quantities of data and gleaning new insights from that analysis-which is part of what is known as big data. As a result, there are unprecedented opportunities to use big data to reduce the costs of health care in the United States. We present six use cases-that is, key examples-where some of the clearest opportunities exist to reduce costs through the use of big data: high-cost patients, readmissions, triage, decompensation (when a patient's condition worsens), adverse events, and treatment optimization for diseases affecting multiple organ systems. We discuss the types of insights that are likely to emerge from clinical analytics, the types of data needed to obtain such insights, and the infrastructure-analytics, algorithms, registries, assessment scores, monitoring devices, and so forth-that organizations will need to perform the necessary analyses and to implement changes that will improve care while reducing costs. Our findings have policy implications for regulatory oversight, ways to address privacy concerns, and the support of research on analytics. {\textcopyright} 2014 by Project HOPE - The People-to-People Health Foundation.},

abstract = {This article was originally drafted just four weeks after the publishing of Dataclysm, a 2014 book by Christian Rudder that sought to popularize data and data science by, in part, dismissing the social sciences and humanities as obsolete approaches to knowledge production. In looking for a potential way of responding to data scientists like Rudder, this article examines a 1948-50 essay about data that was written by Lionel Trilling (1905-75). Trilling frames data as part of our broader cultural history, which includes literature, drama, epic poetry, and the arts. This article argues that what Trilling models in the essay is a line of writing and thinking about data--a type of data criticism--that today offers tremendous promise for responding to data science and to evangelists like Christian Rudder.

abstract = {Background: Medicine and biomedical sciences have become data-intensive fields, which, at the same time, enable the application of data-driven approaches and require sophisticated data analysis and data mining methods. Biomedical informatics provides a proper interdisciplinary context to integrate data and knowledge when processing available information, with the aim of giving effective decision-making support in clinics and translational research. Objectives: To reflect on different perspectives related to the role of data analysis and data mining in biomedical informatics. Methods: On the occasion of the 50th year of Methods of Information in Medicine a symposium was organized, which reflected on opportunities, challenges and priorities of or-ganizing, representing and analysing data, information and knowledge in biomedicine and health care. The contributions of experts with a variety of backgrounds in the area of biomedical data analysis have been collected as one outcome of this symposium, in order to provide a broad, though coherent, overview of some of the most interesting aspects of the field. Results: The paper presents sections on data accumulation and data-driven approaches in medical informatics, data and knowledge integration, statistical issues for the evaluation of data mining models, translational bio - informatics and bioinformatics aspects of genetic epidemiology. Conclusions: Biomedical informatics represents a natural framework to properly and effectively apply data analysis and data mining methods in a decision-making context. In the future, it will be necessary to preserve the inclusive nature of the field and to foster an increasing sharing of data and methods between researchers. {\textcopyright} Schattauer 2011.},

abstract = {Remote data access, defined as the ability of a researcher to access and evaluate restricted micro data via a secure internet connection from his home desktop computer at any time, has not been implemented by a German Research Data Centre (RDC) so far. Privacy regulations and especially the problem of access control are reasons why German RDCs are not able to offer restricted data via remote data access to the research community. By initiating the "RDC-in-RDC" approach, the Research Data Centre (FDZ) of the German Federal Employment Agency (BA) at the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) in Nuremberg, Germany, aims to bring data access in Germany closer to the ideal perception of remote access. The basic idea is to allow remote data access from designated institutions with comparable standards at locations other than Nuremberg. In a first step, access to BA and IAB data will be granted from four sites in Germany and one site in the US. Moreover, the RDCin- RDC approach represents a change of paradigms in two respects. First, data access will be decentralised and the FDZ literally brings its data closer to the researchers. Second, data of the FDZ will be accessible from abroad so the dissemination of micro data will be no longer restricted to national borders. The RDC-in-RDC approach may therefore be regarded as a first step towards remote access in Germany and may also represent a blue print for an intensified international data sharing [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of IASSIST Quarterly is the property of IASSIST Quarterly and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

abstract = {In recent years, there has been considerable discussion about the key role which university libraries can play by engaging with their research community. As a result libraries are scoping, developing and implementing new roles and service models, especially in the relatively new area of research data. This article explores the specific challenges experienced by a traditional academic librarian at Griffith University as she moved into a new role as a data librarian. It was found that this transition needed to be underpinned by a skills development programme, a mentor/coach and a support network of specialists. The authors then outline some strategies to facilitate this type of role transition, which include investing in a range of training and staff development activities, leveraging existing core librarian capabilities and understanding the researcher perspective. The article concludes with a suggestion that several national organisations will continue to have an important role in supporting librarians as they develop new skills.

The current data environment was designed to allow the various business functions to manage relatively small and predictable data sets that required limited sharing across departments or functions, effectively creating business-based silos. The Office of the Chief Data Officer was created in May 2013 to address the data needs of the Board, postfinancial crisis, with an enterprise focus and a clear set of mandates to enhance data governance, data management, and data integration. The OCDO started operations with a small staff of data management professionals who traditionally supported the research function and now must shift gears to provide data services to a broader base of users and a wider range of analytical work. New infrastructures, programs, processes and staffing are being developed and deployed to ensure that data needs across the lifecycle are met and that a variety of analytical approaches can be supported.

Being realized to maintain and give access to the results of complementary phases of the scientific research process, such systems are poorly integrated with one another and generally do not rely on the strengths of the other. Today, such a gap hampers achieving the objectives of the modern scientific communication, that is, publishing, interlinking, and discovery of all outcomes of the research process, from the experimental and observational datasets to the final paper. In this work, we envision that instrumental to bridge the gap is the construction of “Scientific Communication Infrastructures”. The main goal of these infrastructures is to facilitate interoperability between Data Centers and RDLs and to provide services that simplify the implementation of the large variety of modern scientific communication patterns.

The five colleges collectively belong to a consortium known as the Northwest Five Consortium. Over 10 months, librarians from the five schools collaborated to plan a data management and curation workshop with the goals of developing relationships with researchers working with data, developing their own research data management skills and services, and building a model for future training and outreach around institutional research data management services. This workshop brought together research teams including faculty, students, and librarians, and incorporated active learning modules as well as in-depth pre-workshop discussion. This article will discuss the context and background for this workshop, the model itself, and the outcomes and possibilities for future developments.

abstract = {Research data management represents a significant professional development area for academic librarians – significant for its growing importance to the profession, since researchers are increasingly expected to comply with research data management requirements, and for the extent of competence needed by librarians to support researchers in research data management practices and plans. This article recounts how the Association of College and Research Libraries is fostering professional development opportunities in research data management. The authors describe two key endeavors: (1) the development and deployment of a needs assessment survey, which allowed insight into the types of librarians expressing the most need; and (2) planning and implementation of a pre-conference workshop for ACRL 2015, intended to prototype a future professional development offering. The article concludes by discussing additional assessment that was done following the workshop and how the pre-conference laid the foundation for proposing a “roadshow” for research data management, similar to what the Association of College and Research Libraries sponsors for scholarly communication.

abstract = {The activities in our current world are mainly supported by data-driven web applications, making extensive use of databases and data services. Such phenomenon led to the rise of Data Scientists as professionals of major relevance, which extract value from data and create state-of-the-art data artifacts that generate even more increased value. During the last years, the term Data Scientist attracted significant attention. Consequently, it is relevant to understand its origin, knowledge base and skills set, in order to adequately describe its profile and distinguish it from others like Business Analyst. This work proposes a conceptual model for the professional profile of a Data Scientist and evaluates the representativeness of this profile in two commonly recognized competences/skills frameworks in the field of Information and Communications Technology (ICT), namely in the European e-Competence (e-CF) framework and the Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA). The results indicate that a significant part of the knowledge base and skills set of Data Scientists are related with ICT competences/skills, including programming, machine learning and databases. The Data Scientist professional profile has an adequate representativeness in these two frameworks, but it is mainly seen as a multi-disciplinary profile, combining contributes from different areas, such as computer science, statistics and mathematics.

abstract = {This article reports an international study of research data management (RDM) activities, services, and capabilities in higher education libraries. It presents the results of a survey covering higher education libraries in Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the UK. The results indicate that libraries have provided leadership in RDM, particularly in advocacy and policy development. Service development is still limited, focused especially on advisory and consultancy services (such as data management planning support and data-related training), rather than technical services (such as provision of a data catalog, and curation of active data). Data curation skills development is underway in libraries, but skills and capabilities are not consistently in place and remain a concern. Other major challenges include resourcing, working with other support services, and achieving "buy in" from researchers and senior managers. Results are compared with previous studies in order to assess trends and relative maturity levels. The range of RDM activities explored in this study are positioned on a "landscape maturity model," which reflects current and planned research data services and practice in academic libraries, representing a "snapshot" of current developments and a baseline for future research.

abstract = {Information is now available in an overabundance, so much so, that distinguishing the noise from the signal has become very problematic. In the past, the collection and storage of information was the primary issue. Currently, there are massive amounts of data both structured and unstructured, that need to be analyzed in an iterative, as well as in a time sensitive manner. In response to this need, data analytical tools and services have emerged as a means to solve this problem. Grey literature repositories, libraries, and information centers are well positioned to take advantage of these new tools and services. The current trend is to make grey literature more easily discoverable, accessible, and with the new data analytical tools and services, more easily analyzed. The intent of our survey of the Grey Literature community was to provide a snapshot of the Community's use, planned use, and knowledge of data analytical tools/services for big data as it affects grey literature. The survey summary that follows indicates where the Community currently stands in regards to the use of data analytical tools and services.

Twenty-seven faculty members were interviewed to determine attitudes and behaviors pertaining to using data in the classroom and whether easier access to secondary data allows for integration into a broader range of courses. The results of this study suggest a lack of awareness and skill deficits among faculty. These findings provide insights for librarians interested in working with faculty in supporting and promoting the use of open data online analysis, along with traditional quantitative data services in the social sciences and professional disciplines. Preliminary strategies developed in the year following this research study are also discussed.

abstract = {Objective A memory clinic at an academic medical center has relied on several ad hoc data capture systems including Microsoft Access and Excel for cognitive assessments over the last several years. However these solutions are challenging to maintain and limit the potential of hypothesis-driven or longitudinal research. REDCap, a secure web application based on PHP and MySQL, is a practical solution for improving data capture and organization. Here, we present a workflow and toolset to facilitate legacy data migration and real-time clinical research data collection into REDCap as well as challenges encountered. Materials and methods Legacy data consisted of neuropsychological tests stored in over 4000 Excel workbooks. Functions for data extraction, norm scoring, converting to REDCap-compatible formats, accessing the REDCap API, and clinical report generation were developed and executed in Python. Results Over 400 unique data points for each workbook were migrated and integrated into our REDCap database. Moving forward, our REDCap-based system replaces the Excel-based data collection method as well as eases the integration into the standard clinical research workflow and Electronic Health Record. Conclusion In the age of growing data, efficient organization and storage of clinical and research data is critical for advancing research and providing efficient patient care. We believe that the workflow and tools described in this work to promote legacy data integration as well as real time data collection into REDCap ultimately facilitate these goals. {\textcopyright} 2016},

abstract = {While some Canadian universities have a long history in the provision of data services, that was not the norm in Canada, especially in small universities and colleges. To maximize the use of data by students and researchers in academia, it was evident that increased education, resources, and tools were required to support those delivering data services on their campuses. To this end, the Data Liberation Initiative (DLI) Survival Guide was designed as a comprehensive reference tool, which complements an established regional training curriculum, whereby enabling librarians to effectively fulfill their role as a DLI Contact in their academic institutions. This case study will examine the history, current state, and recommended future direction of the Survival Guide. This article will also examine the challenges in understanding the drivers shaping academic service delivery and the ways in which the guide has evolved to remain current to the needs of the Canadian data community.

abstract = {Biomedical Informatics is a growing interdisciplinary field in which research topics and citation trends have been evolving rapidly in recent years. To analyze these data in a fast, reproducible manner, automation of certain processes is needed. JAMIA is a "generalist" journal for biomedical informatics. Its articles reflect the wide range of topics in informatics. In this study, we retrieved Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and citations of JAMIA articles published between 2009 and 2014. We use tensors (i.e., multidimensional arrays) to represent the interaction among topics, time and citations, and applied tensor decomposition to automate the analysis. The trends represented by tensors were then carefully interpreted and the results were compared with previous findings based on manual topic analysis. A list of most cited JAMIA articles, their topics, and publication trends over recent years is presented. The analyses confirmed previous studies and showed that, from 2012 to 2014, the number of articles related to MeSH terms Methods, Organization {\&} Administration, and Algorithms increased significantly both in number of publications and citations. Citation trends varied widely by topic, with Natural Language Processing having a large number of citations in particular years, and Medical Record Systems, Computerized remaining a very popular topic in all years. {\textcopyright} The Author 2015.},

abstract = {Libraries, particularly academic libraries, are swimming in a sea of data. Librarians often contribute to this by counting every possible patron interaction in an attempt to both define their current situation and to predict future staffing, budgetary, and collection needs. This investigation assessed the effectiveness of using various data sources in predicting future library activity and needs. The authors collected data on in-person and chat reference transactions, electronic journal downloads, database queries, and catalog searches from 2009–12. By analyzing these data points, the authors hypothesized they would find correlations that might be predictive of changes in related library services. Results indicated that the strongest correlations track activity over the course of the academic calendar. While none of the data points examined had predictive properties, the strong correlations between the data points over the period of time studied indicated that any one of them might serve as a stand-alone indicator of usage.

However, in the performing arts fields, academics see themselves on a spectrum between scholar and artist. Artistic scholarly research activities are often driven by the same requirements as humanities research. However, as artists, research often takes the form of listening to or watching performances. In this approach, performances and recordings are research data to these academics. How can libraries support this method of research? What are the implications for data curation in libraries?

abstract = {Aligning data and research infrastructure is, as our daily work often reminds us, a difficult process. While data professionals often focus on research lifecycles, incentives, storage and transmission technologies, metadata and data sharing we tend to overlook the epistemological incongruences of diverse research and data practices. All data creation processes, even if unknowingly, make assumptions about the world and what exists as a unique unit that can be analyzed. In attempting to make data meaningful to different audiences, especially across disciplines, we must pay attention to these epistemological assumptions. Failure to do so will inevitably frustrate our attempts to develop meaningful infrastructure for research data and even potentially undermine effective research through misunderstandings of data. Looking at census and zip code data as examples, this paper explores the issue of unit of analysis as an example of such disciplinary epistemological assumptions. The complexities that arise even in these simple examples suggest the importance of addressing the theoretical complexities of dealing with data collections, management and interpretation.

abstract = {Objective: The study investigated veterinary medicine librarians' experience with and perceptions of research data services. Many academic libraries have begun to offer research data services in response to researchers' increased need for data management support. To date, such services have typically been generic, rather than discipline-specific, to appeal to a wide variety of researchers. Methods: An online survey was deployed to identify trends regarding research data services in veterinary medicine libraries. Participants were identified from a list of contacts from the MLA Veterinary Medical Libraries Section. Results: Although many respondents indicated that they have a professional interest in research data services, the majority of veterinary medicine librarians only rarely or occasionally provide data management support as part of their regular job responsibilities. There was little consensus as to whether research data services should be core to a library's mission despite their perceived importance to the advancement of veterinary research. Furthermore, most respondents stated that research data services are just as or somewhat less important than the other services that they provide and feel only slightly or somewhat prepared to offer such services. Conclusions: Lacking a standard definition of ''research data'' and a common understanding of precisely what research data services encompass, it is difficult for veterinary medicine librarians and libraries to define and understand their roles in research data services. Nonetheless, they appear to have an interest in learning more about and providing research data services.

Besides this, theory and principles, as well as selected examples of best practices in the relevant fields are presented.Design/methodology/approach A literature-based overview of actual insights on tasks and roles that academic and research libraries have to fulfil in order to react to the developments generated by the appearance and growing importance of Research 2.0 is provided. Taking the wide spectre of related issues into account, the discussion is limited to RDSs.Findings Even though Research 2.0 is evolving in different countries and some local environments in dissimilar ways, its data-intensive nature requires the helping presence of academic libraries and librarians. Being an emerging phenomenon, it will undoubtedly take several different shapes as it works itself out in time, but librarians should try to discover service niches, which may not be covered by other academic organisations, or their coverage is only partial or even unsatisfactory.Research limitations/implications Taking the wide spectre of issues into account, the review of literature is limited to the period between 2014 and 2016.Originality/value The paper intends to add to the body of knowledge about the relationship between RDSs and Research 2.0, as well as about the association between the components of the former.

The differing terms and their relationship to the most important literacies are examined. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – By stressing the importance of data literacy in fulfilling the mission of the contemporary academic library, the paper centres on information literacy, while the characteristics of other relevant literacies are also examined. The content of data literacy education is explained in the context of data-related activities. Findings – It can be concluded that there is a need for data literacy and it is advantageous to have a unified terminology. Data literacy can be offered both to researchers, who need to become data literate science workers and have the goal to educate data management professionals. Several lists of competencies contain important skills and abilities, many of them indicating the close relationship between data literacy and information literacy. It is vital to take a critical stance on hopes and fears, related to the promises of widespread ability of (big) data.

Data literacy is vital for researchers who need to become data literate science workers and also for (potential) data management professionals. Its important characteristic is a close connection and similarity to information literacy. To support this argument, a review of literature was undertaken on the importance of data, and the data-intensive paradigm of scientific research, researchers' expected and real behaviour, the nature of research data management, the possible roles of the academic library, data quality and data citation, Besides describing the nature of data literacy and enumerating the related skills, the application of phenomenographic approaches to data literacy and its relationship to the digital humanities have been identified as subjects for further investigation.

abstract = {Data governance and data literacy are two important building blocks in the knowledge base of information professionals involved in supporting data-intensive research, and both address data quality and research data management. Applying data governance to research data management processes and data literacy education helps in delineating decision domains and defining accountability for decision making. Adopting data governance is advantageous, because it is a service based on standardised, repeatable processes and is designed to enable the transparency of data-related processes and cost reduction. It is also useful, because it refers to rules, policies, standards; decision rights; accountabilities and methods of enforcement. Therefore, although it received more attention in corporate settings and some of the skills related to it are already possessed by librarians, knowledge on data governance is foundational for research data services, especially as it appears on all levels of research data services, and is applicable to big data.

abstract = {We followed a systematic approach based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses to identify existing clinical natural language processing (NLP) systems that generate structured information from unstructured free text. Seven literature databases were searched with a query combining the concepts of natural language processing and structured data capture. Two reviewers screened all records for relevance during two screening phases, and information about clinical NLP systems was collected from the final set of papers. A total of 7149 records (after removing duplicates) were retrieved and screened, and 86 were determined to fit the review criteria. These papers contained information about 71 different clinical NLP systems, which were then analyzed. The NLP systems address a wide variety of important clinical and research tasks. Certain tasks are well addressed by the existing systems, while others remain as open challenges that only a small number of systems attempt, such as extraction of temporal information or normalization of concepts to standard terminologies. This review has identified many NLP systems capable of processing clinical free text and generating structured output, and the information collected and evaluated here will be important for prioritizing development of new approaches for clinical NLP. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Agile methodologies were introduced in 2001. Since this time, practitioners have applied Agile methodologies to many delivery disciplines. This article explores the application of Agile methodologies and principles to business intelligence delivery and how Agile has changed with the evolution of business intelligence. Business intelligence has evolved because the amount of data generated through the internet and smart devices has grown exponentially altering how organizations and individuals use information. The practice of business intelligence delivery with an Agile methodology has matured; however, business intelligence has evolved altering the use of Agile principles and practices. The Big Data phenomenon, the volume, variety, and velocity of data, has impacted business intelligence and the use of information. New trends such as fast analytics and data science have emerged as part of business intelligence. This paper addresses how Agile principles and practices have evolved with business intelligence, as well as its challenges and future directions.

Twelve researchers from diverse fields have been interviewed, including biology, cultural studies, economics, environmental studies, geography, history, linguistics, media and psychology. The interviews were structured, guided by the Data Curation Profiles Toolkit developed at Purdue University, with added questions regarding subject metadata. The preliminary analysis indicates that the research data management practices vary greatly among the respondents, and therefore so do the implications for research data services. The added questions on subject metadata indicate needs of services guiding researchers in describing their datasets with adequate metadata.

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to report on an information gathering study on users' research data-related challenges and proposals for library research data services (RDS). This study probes how early career researchers visually conceptualize the research process in their disciplines, their self-reported research data challenges, and their recommendations for library RDS. Design/methodology/approach – Two focus group sessions were undertaken with a total of eight early career researchers. Adopting the visual narrative inquiry method, the participants were asked to sketch the general research process in their domain. The individuals' illustrations of the research process were then used as the basis for reflecting on their data-related needs and potential RDS that would assist them during the research process. Findings – Participants presented a research process that was more personal and, in most cases, more imperfect than the research lifecycle models that academic libraries are increasingly using for RDS development and communication. The authors present their data-related challenges, which included data access barriers, low knowledge of best practices for research data management, the need for a deeper understanding of post-publication impact, and inconsistent awareness of existing library and institution RDS. The authors outline RDS recommendations that participants proposed, which included a web-based tools, customized training sessions, and “distilled” guides to research data best practices. Practical implications – The study flagged users' gaps in understandings of existing library and institutional RDS, suggesting that there may be an opportunity to engage users in the design of communications plans for services. The findings from this user study will inform the development of RDS at the institution. Originality/value – This paper puts forth a methodological approach that academic libraries can adapt for understanding users' needs and user-generated design solutions.

We examined patient characteristics, treatment patterns, and survival among elderly patients in routine clinical practice. We utilized a retrospective cohort analysis of first primary AML patients in the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. Patients were diagnosed between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2009, {\textgreater}66 years, and continuously enrolled in Medicare Part A and B in the year prior to diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression assessed overall survival by treatment. There were 3327 (40 {\%}) patients who received chemotherapy within 3 months of diagnosis. Treated patients were more likely younger, male, and married, and less likely to have secondary AML and poor performance indicators and comorbidity score compared to untreated patients. In multivariate survival analysis, treated patients exhibited a significant 33 {\%} lower risk of death compared to untreated patients. Significant survival benefits were noted with receipt of intensive and hypomethylating agent (HMA) therapies compared to no therapy. A survival benefit with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was seen in younger Medicare patients. This real-world study showed that about 60 {\%} of elderly AML patients remain untreated following diagnosis. Use of anti-leukemic therapy was associated with a significant survival benefit in this elderly cohort. {\textcopyright} 2015, The Author(s).},

abstract = {Background: Studies have sought to define information needs of health workers within very specific settings or projects. Lacking in the literature is how hospitals in low-income settings are able to meet the information needs of their staff and the use of information communication technologies (ICT) in day-to-day information searching. Objective: The study aimed to explore where professionals in Kenyan hospitals turn to for work-related information in their day-to-day work. Additionally, it examined what existing solutions are provided by hospitals with regard to provision of best practice care. Lastly, the study explored the use of ICT in information searching. Design: Data for this study were collected in July 2012. Self-administered questionnaires (SAQs) were distributed across 22 study hospitals with an aim to get a response from 34 health workers per hospital. Results: SAQs were collected from 657 health workers. The most popular sources of information to guide work were fellow health workers and printed guidelines while the least popular were scientific journals. Of value to health workers were: national treatment policies, new research findings, regular reports from surveillance data, information on costs of services and information on their performance of routine clinical tasks; however, hospitals only partially met these needs. Barriers to accessing information sources included: 'not available/difficult to get' and 'difficult to understand'. ICT use for information seeking was reported and with demographic specific differences noted from the multivariate logistic regression model; nurses compared to medical doctors and older workers were less likely to use ICT for health information searching. Barriers to accessing Internet were identified as: high costs and the lack of the service at home or at work. Conclusions: Hospitals need to provide appropriate information by improving information dissemination efforts and providing an enabling environment that allows health workers find the information they need for best practice. {\textcopyright} 2015 Naomi Muinga et al.},

Using the premise that bad information is processed more thoroughly than good, the authors integrate that premise into an exploration of the alignment (or nonalignment) of library-emanating data management communications with the divergent expectations of researchers in different academic domains. How might the notion that bad information resonates better with researchers be used to inform the ways that libraries promote data services and communicate about data management practices? And could these approaches differ across disciplines? Insights concerning possible misalignment of current communications could lead to corrective action.

abstract = {REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a web-based software solution and tool set that allows biomedical researchers to create secure online forms for data capture, management and analysis with minimal effort and training. The Shared Data Instrument Library (SDIL) is a relatively new component of REDCap that allows sharing of commonly used data collection instruments for immediate study use by research teams. Objectives of the SDIL project include: (1) facilitating reuse of data dictionaries and reducing duplication of effort; (2) promoting the use of validated data collection instruments, data standards and best practices; and (3) promoting research collaboration and data sharing. Instruments submitted to the library are reviewed by a library oversight committee, with rotating membership from multiple institutions, which ensures quality, relevance and legality of shared instruments. The design allows researchers to download the instruments in a consumable electronic format in the REDCap environment. At the time of this writing, the SDIL contains over 128 data collection instruments. Over 2500 instances of instruments have been downloaded by researchers at multiple institutions. In this paper we describe the library platform, provide detail about experience gained during the first 25. months of sharing public domain instruments and provide evidence of impact for the SDIL across the REDCap consortium research community. We postulate that the shared library of instruments reduces the burden of adhering to sound data collection principles while promoting best practices. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {While institutions, methodology and geography all present barriers for communication and development of infrastructure, sometimes the greatest barriers may be in reaching not across the world but across the hallway. Engaging in the work of unified infrastructure requires finding language that bridges modes of inquiry and meaning, so that all participants see their place in the whole. This work of finding shared language involves translation at many levels. Data librarians know that not everyone means the same thing by 'data' and increasingly they seek language that spans the practices of social science, sciences, humanities, and performing arts. This paper aims to highlight some of the ways in which data professionals are already adept at translation. Drawing on examples from work as a subject librarian and data professional at an undergraduate institution, I will elaborate on ways in which translation permeates the daily work of data librarians, from helping new researchers learn the language and methods of a field, to supporting faculty as they expand their teaching and research across disciplines. Additionally, librarians' role as semi-outsiders within the institution situates them well to help drive conversations spanning disciplinary modes of thinking, in which faculty may also find themselves as semi-outsiders.

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between research data management (RDM) and data sharing in the formulation of RDM policies and development of practices in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Design/methodology/approach – Two strands of work were undertaken sequentially: first, content analysis of 37 RDM policies from UK HEIs; and second, two detailed case studies of institutions with different approaches to RDM based on semi-structured interviews with staff involved in the development of RDM policy and services. The data are interpreted using insights from Actor Network Theory. Findings – RDM policy formation and service development has created a complex set of networks within and beyond institutions involving different professional groups with widely varying priorities shaping activities. Data sharing is considered an important activity in the policies and services of HEIs studied, but its prominence can in most cases be attributed to the positions adopted by large research funders. Research limitations/implications – The case studies, as research based on qualitative data, cannot be assumed to be universally applicable but do illustrate a variety of issues and challenges experienced more generally, particularly in the UK. Practical implications – The research may help to inform development of policy and practice in RDM in HEIs and funder organisations. Originality/value – This paper makes an early contribution to the RDM literature on the specific topic of the relationship between RDM policy and services, and openness – a topic which to date has received limited attention.

abstract = {Objective Management of children with unilateral hearing loss is not standardized. The primary goal of this study was to elicit patient- and parent-reported perspectives regarding usage of hearing devices in pediatric UHL and to suggest a basic algorithmic approach to management. Methods Our tertiary care center recruited families of youth ages 5–19 years with unilateral hearing loss from January 2014 through October 2015. Parents of all youths completed a 36-item survey, and some youth ages 11–19 years participated in hour-long interviews. We assessed patterns of hearing device usage among participants, and performed qualitative data analysis to understand factors considered by youths when deciding whether or not to use a hearing device. Results Survey information was collected for 50 patients. Distribution of hearing loss severity in affected ear was mild 14{\%}, moderate 26{\%}, severe 22{\%}, and profound 38{\%}. The majority of children had sensorineural hearing loss (57{\%}), followed by mixed (32{\%}), and then conductive (11{\%}). 34 children (68{\%}) had tried a hearing device; 20 continued to use the device. Retention rates were similar among children with different degrees of hearing loss: mild 66{\%}, moderate 50{\%}, severe 60{\%}, profound 64{\%}. Sixteen children tried a wireless contralateral routing of signal (CROS) device, and 15 tried a behind-the-ear (BTE) hearing aid. Retention rates for CROS and BTE devices were 69{\%} and 47{\%}, respectively. The most common reason for cessation of use was discomfort, followed by lack of benefit. Conclusion A majority of children with unilateral hearing loss who tried a hearing device continued to use it, and retention rates were similar across all degrees of hearing loss. These findings suggest that personal hearing devices should be included in management protocols. {\textcopyright} 2016},

abstract = {Managing research data has become an issue for many universities. In the Caribbean, the St Augustine Campus Libraries at the University of the West Indies are keenly aware of the need to support researchers in this regard. The objectives of this study were to identify current practices in managing research data on the campus and to determine a possible role for the Campus Libraries. A pilot study of 100 researchers on the campus was conducted. Analysis of the 65 valid responses revealed that while researchers owned data sets they had little knowledge or experience in managing such. This low level of awareness is instructive and validates a role for the Campus Libraries to play in supporting researchers on campus. The Campus Libraries need to sensitize researchers about what data planning and managing research data entail as well as provide technical assistance with actual data storage.

Over the 15 years since the VADS image repository was first launched, and as the internet has rapidly expanded and transformed, the VADS team has also sought project funding to explore and address new themes and issues that have emerged within the arts education sector. Three of these recent collaborative endeavours are detailed in this article: the Kultur II Group which is supporting the development of institutional repositories in the arts; the Spot the Difference project which is researching the emergence and extent of a perceived 'copy and paste' culture; and the Look-Here! project, which has worked with ten partners to foster digitisation skills and strategies in the arts.

abstract = {In this study, an exploratory content analysis of 30 randomly selected Data Science (DS) programs from eight disciplines revealed significant gaps in current DS education in the United States. The analysis centers on linguistic patterns of program descriptions, curriculum requirements, and DS course focus as pertaining to key skills and domain knowledge. The results show that a range of unique terms was used in individual program descriptions, with common terms being shared across disciplines. DS programs required varying numbers of credit hours, including practicum and capstone. Most DS courses covered the basic level of analytical skills, but upper-level skills were inadequately addressed. Programs in eight disciplines delivered information skills through their core courses, and four addressed communication skills. Six disciplines covered visualization skills through their core courses, yet just three in elective courses. The course offering on mathematics/statistics was rather weak in iSchools. While core courses in iSchools provided communication and visualization skills, their electives courses did not address such skills. These findings have implications for improving DS education in iSchools and across other disciplines.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Programs for geospatial support at academic libraries have evolved over the past decade in response to changing campus needs and developing technologies. Geospatial applications have matured tremendously in this time, emerging from specialty tools to become broadly used across numerous disciplines. At many universities, the library has served as a central resource allowing students and faculty across academic departments access to GIS resources. Today, as many academic libraries evaluate their spaces and services, GIS and data services are central in discussions on how to further engage with patrons and meet increasingly diverse researcher needs. As library programs evolve to support increasingly technical data and GIS needs, many universities are faced with similar challenges and opportunities. To explore these themes, data and GIS services librarians and GIS specialists from five universities—the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Texas A{\&}M, New York University, North Carolina State University, and California Polytechnic State University—with different models of library geospatial and data support, describe their programs to help identify common services, as well as unique challenges, opportunities, and future plans.

abstract = {Purpose – This paper aims to find the current situation of research data services by academic libraries and summarize some strategies for university libraries to reference. Recent years have seen an increasing number of university libraries extended their traditional roles and provided research data services. Design/methodology/approach – This paper selected 87 libraries of the top 100 universities listed in the World's Best Universities released by the USA News in October 2012 as samples and conducted a Web site investigation to check if there were any research data services provided. In addition, it made an interview with the Wuhan University Library's Research Data Service Workgroup to understand the procedure, difficulties and experiences of their research data service. Based on the survey and interview, it analyzed the current status and difficulties of research data services in university libraries and proposed some strategies for others to reference. Findings – Of the 87 university libraries investigated, 50 libraries have offered research data services. Most of the services can be divided into six aspects: research data introduction, data management guideline, data curation and storage service, data management training, data management reference and resource recommendation. Among these services, research data introduction is the most frequently provided (47.13 per cent), followed by data curation and storage services (43.68 per cent), data management guideline (42.53 per cent), data management reference (41.38 per cent), resource recommendation (41.38 per cent) and data management training (24.14 per cent). The difficulties met by research data service of Chinese academic libraries are also concluded. Originality/value – Through Web site investigation and interview with the Wuhan University Library's Research Data Service, this paper presented an overall picture of research data services in university libraries and identified the difficulties and experiences of research data services of the Wuhan University Library. Based on some successful examples, it put forward some strategies for university libraries to reference. This study is very useful for academic libraries to promote their research data services.

abstract = {Purpose – This article aims to summarize the employers' requirements of scientific data specialists and the status quo of LIS education organizations' training system for scientific data specialists. It also focuses on the matching analysis between the course content and the responsibilities as well as requirements of scientific data specialists. Moreover, in order to provide some indications for LIS education of scientific data specialists in China, it presents the training objectives and modes. Design/methodology/approach – Some job portals for librarians and the comprehensive job portals are investigated as information sources and the keywords such as "scientific data management", "data service", "data curation", "e-Science", "e-Research", "data specialist" are selected to retrieval library-released job advertisements for scientific data specialists to understand the library's requirements towards scientific data specialists' core capabilities. Meanwhile the course catalogues of all iSchools' web sites are searched directly in order to find if scientific data courses are provided. Findings – Libraries value teamwork ability, communication ability, interpersonal ability and a good use of data curation tools as the core competences for scientific data specialists. Candidates who possess a second advanced degree, who understand libraries, who hold demonstrated knowledge of metadata standards, and who emphasize details, under the same condition, are more likely to be considered first. Libraries do not have a unified title for scientific data specialists yet. The current curriculums of iSchools mainly cover research method, data science, data management and data service, data statistic and analysis, data warehouse, information studies and technologies, and so on. Originality/value – This unique study explores some required qualifications of science data specialist surveyed by job openings, including the core skills, position requirements, responsibilities of the job, and some qualifications. It also investigates the related curriculum setting of iSchool universities through course descriptions. This study is very useful for curriculum development in Chinese LIS education of scientific data specialists including required core courses and selected electives, and to promote the practice of data service in Chinese academic libraries.

In this paper, we present a model for providing flexible, cost-efficient institutional support for clinical and translational research data management and informatics, the research management team, and describe our initial experiences with deploying this model at our institution. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {This article outlines the involvement of the Bodleian Libraries at the University of Oxford in developing new services for research data management. It offers reflections on what such additional support means for academic librarians, specifically considering support offered by subject consultants and a series of research data management (RDM) training workshops. The need to reshape library roles, teams and collections to accommodate developments in support for research data and its management is discussed. Additional actions being carried out within the Bodleian Libraries to help further meet these needs are outlined and include the development of the role of a Data Librarian and engagement of a network of librarians with this expanding area of professional knowledge. This review of what has been achieved so far provides fellow practitioners with valuable lessons and pointers to consider when reviewing the support required within their own institutions.

abstract = {Over the past few years, research reproducibility has been increasingly highlighted as a multifaceted challenge across many disciplines. There are socio-cultural obstacles as well as a constantly changing technical landscape that make replicating and reproducing research extremely difficult. For example, the prioritization of citation counts and journal prestige has undermined incentives to make research reproducible. Technically, researchers face challenges in reproducing research across different operating systems and different versions of software. While libraries have been building support around research data management and digital scholarship, reproducibility is an emerging area that has yet to be systematically addressed. In response, New York University created the position of Librarian for Research Data Management and Reproducibility (RDM {\&} R), a dual appointment between the Center for Data Science (CDS) and the Division of Libraries. This report will outline the role of the RDM {\&} R librarian, with special focus on the collaboration between the CDS and Libraries to bring reproducible research practices into the norm.

abstract = {Background: The New York University Health Sciences Library data services team had developed educational material for research data management and data visualization and had been offering classes at the request of departments, research groups, and training programs, but many members of the medical center were unaware of these library data services. There were also indications of data skills gaps in these subject areas and other data-related topics. Case Presentation: The data services team enlisted instructors from across the medical center with data expertise to teach in a series of classes hosted by the library. We hosted eight classes branded as a series called "Data Day to Day." Seven instructors from four units in the medical center, including the library, taught the classes. A multipronged outreach approach resulted in high turnout. Evaluations indicated that attendees were very satisfied with the instruction, would use the skills learned, and were interested in future classes. Conclusions: Data Day to Day met previously unaddressed data skills gaps. Collaborating with outside instructors allowed the library to serve as a hub for a broad range of data instruction and to raise awareness of library services. We plan to offer the series three times in the coming year with an expanding roster of classes.

Here the results of two studies are reported: librarians' RDS practices in U.S. and Canadian academic research libraries, and the RDS-related library policies in those or similar libraries. Results show that RDS are currently not frequently employed in libraries, but many services are in the planning stages. Technical RDS are less common than informational RDS, RDS are performed more often for faculty than for students, and more library directors believe they offer opportunities for staff to develop RDS-related skills than the percentage of librarians who perceive such opportunities to be available. Librarians need opportunities to learn more about these services either on campus or through attendance at workshops and professional conferences.

abstract = {Research data is an essential part of the scholarly record, and management of research data is increasingly seen as an important role for academic libraries. This article presents the results of a survey of directors of the Association of European Research Libraries (LIBER) academic member libraries to discover what types of research data services (RDS) are being offered by European academic research libraries and what services are planned for the future. Overall, the survey found that library directors strongly agree on the importance of RDS. As was found in earlier studies of academic libraries in North America, more European libraries are currently offering or are planning to offer consultative or reference RDS than technical or hands-on RDS. The majority of libraries provide support for training in skills related to RDS for their staff members. Almost all libraries collaborate with other organizations inside their institutions or with outside institutions in order to offer or develop policy related to RDS. We discuss the implications of the current state of RDS in European academic research libraries, and offer directions for future research.

abstract = {There has been a rapid advancement of information technology in the area of clinical and population health data management since 2000. However, with the fast growth of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing complexity of information systems, it has become challenging for researchers to effectively access, locate, extract, and analyze information critical to their research. This article introduces an outpatient encounter data framework designed to construct an EMR-based population data repository for diabetes screening research. The outpatient encounter data framework is developed on a hybrid data structure of entity-attribute-value models, dimensional models, and relational models. This design preserves a small number of subject-specific tables essential to key clinical constructs in the data repository. It enables atomic information to be maintained in a transparent and meaningful way to researchers and health care practitioners who need to access data and still achieve the same performance level as conventional data warehouse models. A six-layer information processing strategy is developed to extract and transform EMRs to the research data repository. The data structure also complies with both Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act regulations and the institutional review board's requirements. Although developed for diabetes screening research, the design of the outpatient encounter data framework is suitable for other types of health service research. It may also provide organizations a tool to improve health care quality and efficiency, consistent with the "meaningful use" objectives of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act. {\textcopyright} Diabetes Technology Society.},

abstract = {With the emergence of the National Science Foundation requirement for data management plans, academic librarians have increasingly aided researchers in developing these plans and disseminating research data. To determine the overall quality of data management plans at Wayne State University, the Library System's Research Data Services team evaluated the content of 119 plans from National Science Foundation grant proposals submitted between 2012 and 2014. The results of our content analysis indicate that, while most researchers understand the need to share data, many data management plans fail to adequately describe the data generated by the project, how data will be managed during the project, or how data will be preserved and shared after the completion of the project. Our results also show that data management plan deficiencies vary across academic units, suggesting the need for differentiated outreach services to improve the strength of data management plans in future National Science Foundation grant proposals.

abstract = {At Leiden University, it is increasingly recognised that effective data management forms an integral component of responsible research. To actively promote the stewardship of all the research data that are produced at Leiden University, a comprehensive, institution-wide programme was launched in 2015, which centrally aims to encourage its researchers to carefully plan the temporal storage, long-term preservation and potential reuse of their data. This programme, which is managed centrally by the Department of Academic Affairs, and which receives important contributions from academic staff, from Leiden University Libraries, and from the University's central ICT organisation, basically consists of three parts. Firstly, a basic central policy has been formulated, containing clear guidelines for activities before, during and after research projects. The central aim of this institutional policy is to ensure that all Leiden-based research projects can effectively comply with the most common requirements stipulated by funding agencies, academic publishers, the Dutch standard evaluation protocol and the European data protection directive. As a second part of the data management programme, faculties have organised workshops and meetings, concentrating on the rationale and on the technical and organisational practicalities of effective data management in order to bring about a discipline-specific protocol. Data librarians employed by Leiden University Libraries have developed educational materials and provide training for PhDs in the principles and benefits of good data management. Thirdly, to ensure that scholars can genuinely make a reasoned selection among the many tools that are currently available, a central catalogue was developed which lists and characterises the most relevant data management services. The catalogue currently provides information about, amongst many other aspects, the organisations behind these services, the main academic disciplines which are targeted and the accepted file formats and metadata formats. The various aspects of these facilities have been classified using terminology provided by conceptual models developed by the UKDA, ANDS and the DCC. Using Leiden University's policy guidelines as criteria, the overall suitability of each service has also been evaluated. Leiden University's data management programme has a total duration of three years, and its basic objective is to offer a comprehensive form of support, in which the data management policy which is propagated centrally is complemented by various forms of assistance which ought to make it easier for scholars to adhere to this policy. The catalogue of data management services also aims to bolster the implementation of an adequate technical infrastructure, as the qualitative evaluations of the services enable policy-makers and developers to quickly establish gaps or other shortcomings within existing facilities.

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to describe how the authors gained a better understanding of the variety of library users' data needs, and how gradually some new data services were established based on current capabilities. Design/methodology/approach – This paper uses a case study of the new data services at the John Cotton Dana Library, at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Newark campus, to demonstrate the possible ways to extend data reference services and provide data computing services. A content analysis of services records shows how each user group falls into the multiple data services levels and subcategories. Findings – Library users can be classified into many different categories, and each of these may have different needs. Research centers might have big projects involving data gathering and applications where a librarian can mainly provide consultation; while an individual faculty member or student might need the librarians as research partners, with help for their specific problems. Computing data services can involve group training and statistical analysis assistance, where researchers need emergent help. Data librarians can take various opportunities for data management education, thereby gradually raising awareness and cultivating better research habits among researchers. Originality/value – Library data computing services can make unique contributions to faculty and students' research and study. Institution, library and users' interaction determines the levels and extent of data services and is generalized from the description and analysis of typical data service examples. Classic concept of data services levels is applied to a concrete case of data services program, and sub-categories of each data services level and user types are developed based on the authors' services record.

@article{Whitmire2015,
abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how knowledge of local research data management (RDM) practices critically informs the progressive development of research data services (RDS) after basic services have already been established. Design/methodology/approach – An online survey was distributed via e-mail to all university faculty in the fall of 2013, and was left open for just over one month. The authors sent two reminder e-mails before closing the survey. Survey data were downloaded from Qualtrics survey software and analyzed in R. Findings – In this paper, the authors reviewed a subset of survey findings that included data types, volume, and storage locations, RDM roles and responsibilities, and metadata practices. The authors found that Oregon State University (OSU) researchers are generating a wide variety of data types, and that practices vary between colleges. The authors discovered that faculty are not utilizing campus-wide storage infrastructure, and are maintaining their own storage servers in surprising numbers. Faculty-level research assistants perform the majority of data-related tasks at OSU, with the exception of data sharing, which is primarily handled by the professorial ranks. The authors found that many faculty on campus are creating metadata, but that there is a need to provide support in how to discover and create standardized metadata. Originality/value – This paper presents a novel example of how to efficiently move from establishing basic RDM services to providing more focussed services that meet specific local needs. It provides an approach for others to follow when tackling the difficult question of, “What next?” with regard to providing academic RDS.

abstract = {Making connections with faculty can be challenging for librarians developing new data services programs. In order to identify faculty with a variety of data experiences, the author conducted a review of selected recent publications by sixty-two agricultural faculty members at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. As a follow-up, faculty who had publicly shared data beyond that published in an article were contacted directly to request interviews to discuss data sharing. These active, targeted messages have generated more faculty response than the general data services announcements previously broadcast. Bibliographic studies are a known method for librarians, but using this method to identify faculty candidates for data services represents a new application. The advantages and disadvantages of this approach are discussed.

abstract = {Author summary Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to describe the evolution to date and future directions in research data policy, infrastructure, skills development and advisory services in an Australian university, with a focus on the role of librarians. Design/methodology/approach – The authors have been involved in the development of research data services at Griffith, and the case study presents observations and reflections arising from their first-hand experiences. Findings – Griffith University's organisational structure and “whole-of-enterprise” approach has facilitated service development to support research data. Fostering strong national partnerships has also accelerated development of institutional capability. Policies and strategies are supported by pragmatic best practice guidelines aimed directly at researchers. Iterative software development and a commitment to well-supported enterprise infrastructure enable the provision of a range of data management solutions. Training programs, repository support and data planning services are still relatively immature. Griffith recognises that information services staff (including librarians) will need more opportunities to develop knowledge and skills to support these services as they evolve. Originality/value – This case study provides examples of library-led and library-supported activities that could be used for comparative purposes by other libraries. At the same time, it provides a critical perspective by contrasting areas of good practice within the University with those of less satisfactory progress. While other institutions may have different constraints or opportunities, some of the major concepts within this paper may prove useful to advance the development of research data capability and capacity across the library profession.

We examine uses of metadata in clinical studies. We examine and enumerate seven sources of data value-level metadata in clinical studies inclusive of research designs across the spectrum of the National Institutes of Health definition of clinical research. The sources of metadata inform categorization in terms of metadata describing the origin of a data value, the definition of a data value, and operations to which the data value was subjected. The latter is further categorized into information about changes to a data value, movement of a data value, retrieval of a data value, and data quality checks, constraints or assessments to which the data value was subjected.
